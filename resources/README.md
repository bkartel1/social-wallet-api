This software is made to facilitate the integration of blockchain
functions into existing front-end applications, providing an easy
backend of documented REST API endpoints that are validated and, in
case of error, report meaningful messages.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Commonfare-net/social-wallet-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Commonfare-net/social-wallet-api)

This REST API interface is so far meant for low-level access of
wallets built using the [Freecoin toolkit](https://freecoin.dyne.org).

The Social Wallet API allows to make calls to mongo and to running
blockchain nodes that are compatibile with Bitcoin Core and support
the generic Bitcoin RPC.

## Building the Social Wallet API on your own computer

The Social Wallet API is written in Clojure and is fully
cross-platform: one can run it locally on a GNU/Linux machine, as well
on Apple/OSX and MS/Windows.

### Prerequisites:
Please install
1. A JDK. The software is tested on [openJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/) versions 7 and 8 as well as with [oracleJDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html). Make sure that the env var JAVA_HOME is set to the JDK install dir like [mentioned here](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19182-01/820-7851/inst_cli_jdk_javahome_t/index.html).
2. [MongoDB community edition](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/). The software has been tested on Mongo v3.6.4. Earlier versions might not work due to loss of precision (Decimal128 was not introduced).
3. [leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) which is used for dependency management like:
```
mkdir ~/bin
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein -O ~/bin/lein
chmod +x ~/bin/lein
```

For instance on Devuan systems one can install all necessary
dependencies using apt and the following packages: `apt-get
openjdk-7-jdk libversioneer-clojure haveged`.

## Running the Social Wallet API

First of all check the configuration in
`resources/social-wallet-api.yaml` and adjust its contents to your
setup. Here an example complete with comments:

```yaml
# verbosity level of messages
log-level: debug

# open freecoin specific section
freecoin:
# indentation matters: mind the initial spaces of following sections

# configuration for the database holding local transactions
  mongo:
    host: localhost
    port: 27017
    db:   freecoin

# configuration of the 'faircoin' blockchain
  faircoin:
# visualised name of the currency
    currency: fair
# number of confirmations to consider a transaction as valid
    number-confirmations: 6
# frequency of confirmations checks in milliseconds
    frequency-confirmations-millis: 20000
# path to the rpc configuration holding username and password
    rpc-config-path: /home/user/.faircoin2/faircoin.conf
# deposit to an address watch expiration time in milliseconds
    deposit-expiration-millis: 3600000
# frequency of deposit checks in milliseconds
    frequency-deposit-millis: 60000

# configuration of the 'bitcoin' blockchain
  bitcoin:
# visualised name of the currency
    currency: btc
# number of confirmations to consider a transaction as valid
    number-confirmations: 6
# frequency of confirmations checks in milliseconds
    frequency-confirmations-millis: 20000
# path to the rpc configuration holding username and password
    rpc-config-path: /home/user/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
```

Once correctly configured, from inside the social-wallet-api source
directory one can use various commands to run it live (refreshing live
changes to the code) using:

- `lein ring server` (which will start and spawn a browser on it)
- `lein ring server-headless` (will start without browser)

One can also use `lein uberjar` to build a standalone jar application,
or `lein uberwar` to build a standalone war application ready to be
served from enterprise infrastructure using JBoss or Tomcat.
